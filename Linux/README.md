# Linux

# What is Linux?
**Linux** is an open-source, Unix-like operating system (OS) that manages hardware and runs applications. It‚Äôs widely used in servers, embedded systems, smartphones (like Android), and even desktops.

Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is:
- Free and open-source
- Highly customisable
- Built collaboratively by developers and companies worldwide

Linux is based on a **monolithic kernel**, meaning the core of the OS handles most system functions directly.

## Linux Commands in AWS via Git Bash

### Getting Started
To interact with an AWS EC2 instance, connect through Git Bash. You'll typically be using a Linux-based system like Ubuntu.

### Confirm your environment:
```bash
whoami
# output: ubuntu (if you're inside the instance)
```

```bash
uname
uname --help
# Check OS type and get more options
```

```bash
cat /etc/shells
# Shows available shells on the system
```

### Navigation & File System
```bash
ls
# Lists visible files and folders

ls -a
# Includes hidden files (those starting with .)

ls -l
# Long listing format

ls -la
# All files in long format
```

```bash
cd ..
# Move up one directory

cd ~
# Go to home directory

cd /
# Go to root directory
```


### File Operations
#### Viewing File Contents
```bash
cat filename.txt
head filename.txt
tail filename.txt
nl filename.txt
```


#### Search in Files
```bash
cat chicken-joke.txt | grep chicken
# Highlights all lines with the word "chicken"
```

### Creating, Moving, Copying, Deleting
#### Create a Directory
```bash
mkdir funny-stuff
```
#### Create with Spaces
```bash
mkdir "my pictures"
```
#### Move or Rename
```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```
#### Copy
```bash
cp original.txt copy.txt
```
#### Remove a File
```bash
rm file.txt
```
#### Remove Directory (Recursive)
```bash
rm -r directory_name
```
#### Force delete everything (use with extreme caution)
```bash
rm -rf foldername
# Deletes everything in foldername and doesn‚Äôt ask questions
```

### Downloading Files
#### Using curl
```bash
curl https://example.com/image.jpg --output image.jpg
```
#### Using wget
```bash
wget https://example.com/image.jpg -O image2.jpg
```
#### Confirm file type
```bash
file image.jpg
# e.g., JPEG image data
```

### Package Management (Ubuntu/Debian)
#### Step 1: Update
```bash
sudo apt update -y
```
#### Step 2: Upgrade
```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- `sudo` = SuperUser Do
- `-y` = Automatically answers ‚Äúyes‚Äù to prompts

#### Install packages
```bash
sudo apt install tree -y
tree
```


### Switching to Root User
```bash
sudo su
# Switches to root
```

```bash
cd /root
# Only accessible after sudo su
```

```bash
exit
# Exit root mode, back to normal ubuntu user
```


### Bash Scripts
Use scripts to automate installations and configurations.

#### Create script manually
```bash
sudo nano install_nginx.sh
```
#### Make it executable
```bash
sudo chmod +x install_nginx.sh
```

### Sample Bash Script: install_nginx.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# update
sudo apt update -y

# upgrade
sudo apt upgrade -y

# install nginx
sudo apt install nginx -y

# restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# enable nginx on boot
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

#### After running:
```bash
nginx -v
# Check if nginx is installed
```
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
# Check service status (press 'q' to exit)
```

#### Make sure:
- Your AWS security group allows HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22)
- You can access the site using the Public IPv4 address in your EC2 summary

## Linux Processes & Permissions

### Process Management

#### List All Running Processes
```bash
ps aux
# Shows all processes with detailed info: user, PID, CPU, memory, command, etc.
```

#### List Processes for a Specific User
```bash
ps -u <username>
# Lists processes owned by a particular user
```
#### List System Processes (Owned by Root)
```bash
ps -U root -u root u
# Displays system processes run by the root user
```


### What are Child Processes?
A **child process** is a process created by another (parent) process.
Example: When you run a shell script or a command like nano, the shell forks a child process to run it.

You can see parent-child relationships using:

```bash
pstree
```

### Running a Process in the Background
To run a command in the background:
```bash
command &
# Example:
sleep 30 &
```

To see background jobs:
```bash
jobs
```


### Ending a Process
#### Method 1: Using kill with PID
```bash
kill <PID>
```
#### Method 2: Using killall (by name)
```bash
killall <process_name>
```

#### Method 3: Using `top` or `htop`

In `top`: press `k` then enter the PID

In `htop`: use arrow keys to highlight, then press `F9`





### Kill Signals
**1 (SIGHUP)** ‚Äì Hangup signal: Tells the process to reload (used to re-read config).

**15 (SIGTERM)** ‚Äì Terminate: Politely asks the process to stop. Default signal.

**9 (SIGKILL)** ‚Äì Force kill: Immediately ends the process (can‚Äôt be ignored).

Use with:
```bash
kill -<signal> <PID>
# Examples:
kill -1 1234    # Reload process
kill -15 1234   # Graceful shutdown
kill -9 1234    # Force shutdown
```


### Linux Permissions
Linux permissions are based on:

- **User (u)** ‚Äì Owner of the file
- **Group (g)** ‚Äì Group associated with the file
- **Other (o)** ‚Äì Everyone else

Each permission is represented by:
- **r** ‚Äì Read
- **w** ‚Äì Write
- **x** ‚Äì Execute



###  Long Format Permissions (ls -l)
Example:

```bash
-rwxr-xr--
```

Breakdown:
- First character: File type (- = file, d = directory)
- Next 3: Owner permissions (rwx)
- Next 3: Group permissions (r-x)
- Last 3: Other permissions (r--)


### Short Format Permissions (Octal)
Each set of 3 characters converts to a number:
- r = 4
- w = 2
- x = 1

Add them up:
- rwx = 7
- rw- = 6
- r-- = 4
- --- = 0

So:

```bash
chmod 764 file.txt
# Means:
# user: rwx (7)
# group: rw- (6)
# other: r-- (4)
```



### Changing File Permissions
#### Give Execute Permission to User Only
```bash
chmod u+x script.sh
```

#### Remove Write Permission from Group
```bash
chmod g-w file.txt#
```

#### Set Full Permissions for Owner, Read-Only for Others
```bash
chmod 744 file.txt
```

#### Make a File Readable and Writable for All
```bash
chmod 666 notes.txt
```

#### Make a Script Executable by Everyone
```bash
chmod a+x script.sh
```
